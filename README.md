# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

VBA Challenge

Overview 

On this project I've applied my skills and knowledge that i learned in VBA scripting and analyze real stock market data.
I've created a script and running a loop that went all the stocks and have the following output information below.

1. The ticker symbol.
2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4. The total stock volume of the stock.

I've also included to run a loop to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

Testing and Execution of Script

I’ve tested the script on both file alphabetical_testing and the final Multiple_year_stock_data and ran successfully. You can execute the script 
by going to the files and execute the following processes.

1. Go to the file and open the Visual Basic Editor or Alt-F11.
2. Open the Click to Developer Tab.
3. Click Visual Basic to open the editor
4. To View the script go to VBAProject(Multiple_year_stoc_data.xlsm and under Modules 1.

5. Go back to main file.
6. Click on Macros and run stock_analysis. You can also import the Stock Data Analysis1 to run it.                                      
7. The script will run in for little while and produce the below sample output.
